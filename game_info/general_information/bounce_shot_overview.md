# Bounce Shot System Overview

## What is Bounce Shot?
Bounce Shot gives the tower a chance for their projectiles to bounce after hitting an enemy a certain number of times when enemies are in range.

## Workshop Unlock
- **Unlock Cost:** 10,000 coins
- **Prerequisite:** Must unlock Rapid Fire first
- **Unlocks:** Bounce Shot Chance, Bounce Shot Targets, and Bounce Shot Range

## Core Mechanics
- Projectiles have a chance to bounce from enemy to enemy
- Bounce range determines how far projectiles can travel between enemies
- Number of targets determines how many times a projectile can bounce
- Enemies targeted by bounce shot cannot be hit toward the tower with knockback
- Once a target is selected, the projectile will chase that enemy even if knocked beyond maximum bounce range

## Integration with Other Systems
- **Perks:** Bounce Shot perk can increase maximum targets from 8 to 14
- **Modules:** Various cannon modules can enhance bounce shot mechanics
- **Cards:** Bounce shot mechanics may be affected by certain cards
