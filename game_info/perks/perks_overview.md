# Perks System Overview

## What are Perks?
Perks are advantages earned in a round that provide various bonuses and improvements to your tower's capabilities.

## Perk Categories
There are three main categories of perks:

- **Standard Perks** (65% appearance chance) - Basic stat improvements and utility bonuses
- **Ultimate Weapon Perks** (20% appearance chance) - Enhancements for specific ultimate weapons
- **Trade-off Perks** (15% appearance chance) - Powerful bonuses with significant drawbacks

## Unlocking Perks
Perks are initially unlocked in labs. To access the lab you will need to unlock and complete the Unlock Perks lab in Milestones at tier 2 wave 150.

## How Perks Work
- Perks are earned starting at wave 200
- After selecting 20 perks, waves required increases to 250

- The base wave requirement can be reduced through lab upgrades and specific perks

## Perk Selection
