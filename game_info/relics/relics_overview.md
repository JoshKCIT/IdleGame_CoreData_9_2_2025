# Relics System Overview

## What are Relics?
Relics are passive buffs that increase tower abilities. They are permanent upgrades that provide various bonuses and improvements to your tower's capabilities once unlocked.

## How Relics Work
- Relics are **passive** and used automatically after the relic is unlocked
- The bonuses are **additive** with similar relics and **multiplicative** with other bonuses
- Once unlocked, relics provide permanent stat improvements
- Relics cannot be equipped or unequipped - they are always active once obtained

## Unlocking Relics
Relic unlocks can be viewed in the Themes Menu. There are 6 main methods of unlocking relics:

1. **Milestones** - Beat wave 4500 in different tiers (T:I through T:XXI)
2. **Tournament placement** - Finish in top 4 of various tournament brackets
3. **Event completion & store** - Earn medals during special events
4. **Guild store** - Spend guild tokens during guild seasons
5. **Years of gameplay** - Anniversary rewards for playing the game
6. **Event store** - Event store relics can only be obtained on event re-runs

Relics come in three rarities with different bonus magnitudes:
