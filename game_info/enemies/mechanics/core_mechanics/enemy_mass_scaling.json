  "mechanics": {
    "mass_increase": "Enemy mass increases by 4% each wave they are alive",
    "applies_to_all": "This applies to all enemy types (Normal, Elite, Boss, Fleet)",
    "cumulative_effect": "The mass increase is cumulative and continues to stack",
    "affects_interactions": "Mass affects various game mechanics that depend on enemy weight/size"

    "knockback_effects": "Higher mass enemies are harder to knock back",
    "ultimate_weapon_interactions": "Some ultimate weapons have effects that scale with enemy mass",
    "collision_detection": "Mass may affect how enemies interact with each other and the environment",
    "module_effects": "Some modules may have effects that depend on enemy mass"
  },
  "strategic_implications": [
    "Enemies that survive multiple waves become harder to control with knockback effects",
    "Some ultimate weapons may become less effective against high-mass enemies",
    "Players should consider mass scaling when planning defensive strategies",
    "The mechanic creates additional incentive to defeat enemies quickly"
  ],
  "counterplay": [
    "Focus on defeating enemies before they accumulate too much mass",
    "Use ultimate weapons that aren't affected by mass scaling",
    "Consider using abilities that don't rely on knockback or mass-dependent effects",
    "Prioritize high-mass enemies that are approaching the tower"
