    "decay_threshold": "Enemies lose 50% of their coin value if they are alive for more than 3 waves",
    "applies_to_all": "This applies to all enemy types (Normal, Elite, Boss, Fleet)",
    "decay_type": "The decay is a flat 50% reduction, not a gradual decrease",
    "reset_condition": "The mechanic resets if an enemy is defeated and respawns"

  "strategic_implications": [
    "Players are incentivized to defeat enemies quickly to maximize coin rewards",
    "Enemies that survive multiple waves provide significantly less economic benefit",
    "This creates a trade-off between defensive strategies and economic efficiency",
    "Boss enemies that survive multiple waves become less valuable targets"
  ],
  "economic_impact": [
    "Early wave enemies that survive become poor coin sources",
    "Players should focus on clearing waves efficiently rather than letting enemies accumulate",
    "The mechanic encourages active gameplay over passive strategies",
    "Elite and Fleet enemies that survive multiple waves lose significant value"
  ],
  "counterplay": [
    "Prioritize defeating enemies before they reach the 3-wave threshold",
    "Use area-of-effect abilities to clear groups of enemies quickly",
    "Focus on high-value enemies (Bosses, Elites) to prevent coin decay",
    "Consider using ultimate weapons to clear waves efficiently"
