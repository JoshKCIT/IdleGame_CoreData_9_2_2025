# Bots System Overview

## Introduction
Bots are powerful automated units that provide various effects in an area around your tower. They are unlocked and upgraded through the Event Shop using medals earned from events.

## How Bots Work

### Unlocking
- Bots are unlocked in the Event Shop menu
- Unlock cost depends on how many other bots have been purchased
- Each bot must be unlocked before it can be upgraded

### Activation
- Bots activate automatically based on their cooldown timers
- When active, bots affect all enemies within their range
- Bot range is amplified by your tower's range
- Effects last for the bot's duration (varies by bot type)

### Range System
- All bots have a base range that can be upgraded
- Bot range is multiplied by your tower's range
- Range can be further increased with:
  - Relics (various bot range bonuses)
  - Vault upgrades
  - Lab research

## Bot Types

### Flame Bot
- **Function:** Area damage with burn effects
- **Effects:** 
  - Deals damage to enemies in range
  - Applies burn damage over time
  - Reduces damage dealt by burned enemies
- **Upgrades:** Damage Reduction, Cooldown, Damage, Range

### Thunder Bot

### Amplify Bot
- **Function:** Damage amplification
- **Effects:**

- **Upgrades:** Duration, Cooldown, Bonus, Range

## Upgrade System

### Cost Structure
- Each upgrade starts at 100 medals
- Cost increases by 40 medals per level
- Formula: Cost = 100 + (40 Ã— level)

### Upgrade Paths
Each bot has 3-4 different upgrade paths:
- **Duration:** How long the bot stays active
- **Cooldown:** Time between activations
- **Effect:** The strength of the bot's main effect
- **Range:** The area the bot affects

### Maximum Levels
- Most upgrades have 15-30 levels
- Some upgrades (like cooldown) cap at 15 levels
- Others (like damage/bonus) can reach 30 levels

## Strategic Considerations

### Bot Synergy
- Different bots can work together effectively
- Golden Bot + Amplify Bot = More coins from stronger enemies
- Thunder Bot + Flame Bot = Stunned enemies take more burn damage

### Upgrade Priority
- Consider your playstyle when prioritizing upgrades
- Early game: Focus on range and duration for more coverage
- Late game: Focus on effect strength and cooldown reduction

### Resource Management
- Bot upgrades are expensive (5,700-20,400 medals total per path)
- Plan your medal spending across all bots
- Consider lab research to enhance bot effectiveness

## Lab Research Integration
Bot effectiveness can be enhanced through lab research in the Bot Research category:
- Cooldown reductions
- Duration increases
- Effect enhancements
- Special mechanics (like burn stacking)

## Event Shop Integration
- Bots are purchased with event medals
- Medal costs scale with number of bots already owned
- Events provide the primary source of medals for bot upgrades
